Project: Recipes

## What?

The worlds premiere website used to lookup cooking recipes.

## How?

Create a few pages for the recipes, a landing page and call it the worlds premiere website used to lookup cooking recipes.

## Recap?

After the project is finished, I will explain what I've learned completing it.

## Final Recap?

With the project completed. I've learned the importance of good commit messages. The titles as listed in the shortlog and the details for each commit which describes why I chose to implement the change as it is. The code should speak for itself, but when it can't, the commit log is there to support it.

Only commit functional code. Commit whenever there's a change that you may want to revert to update. There's no rush to push, because once you do, consider that final and unable to revert or edit any commits in any way outside of creating a new commit to change it.

I've many questions that I'll likley learn over time.

I've also noticed a new feature in vscode, there's a timeline under the outline that tracks all changes, excited to learn how the feature works.

## Future Lessons?

I need to master git. I have some fantastic resources, a Udemy course as well as Pro Git that both seem to go under the hood. I had an issue with committing a bug or in this case an incomplete description field that I noticed after testing. This type of thing will happen far less when my local server is running as a real-time block-level backing up every saved change. I'm hesistant to use it until I know it's safe to enable auto-save in vscode and have it not impact production or education.
