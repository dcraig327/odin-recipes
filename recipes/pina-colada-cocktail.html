    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A very popular cocktail, the piña colada ("strained pineapple") was
      created in 1954 in Puerto Rico by Ramón "Monchito" Marrero, a local
      bartender at a popular Hilton hotel. Whether blended or shaken, it's a
      great summertime drink with the delicious flavor combination of pineapple
      and coconut backed by your favorite rum.

      This drink is thick, luscious, and filled with flavor, so the choice of
      rum is not as critical here as it is in other cocktails. For the best piña
      colada, choose a decent white rum that you enjoy straight. With many
      reasonably priced options available, you don't have to spend a fortune to
      find a new favorite.

      The frozen piña colada recipe is incredibly simple and requires just a few
      common ingredients. Toss it all in the blender, give it a good whirl, and
      you will have the freshest piña colada possible. Once you discover the
      wonder of a frozen piña colada, there are more coladas to try, including
      the ultra-easy shaken version.

      In the world of tropical cocktails, it's one of the best, and even better
      when you make it from scratch. After the first taste, you'll regret the
      times you bought a piña colada mix. Many bottled piña colada mixes you
      find at the liquor store are filled with artificial ingredients, but our
      recipe tastes as fresh as can be, preservative-free. Plus, you get to make
      a less expensive drink tailored to your personal taste, choosing the
      proportions and having more control over the flavor. Besides, if you buy
      cream of coconut and pineapple juice separately, a whole new list of
      cocktails is at your disposal.
