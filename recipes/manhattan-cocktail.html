    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it
      was invented in New York City’s Manhattan Club, some time around 1880 (as
      the story goes). Over the years, the whiskey classic has dipped in and out
      of fashion before finding its footing as one of the cornerstones of the
      craft cocktail renaissance.
    </p>

      Amazingly, the drink that socialites tipped to their lips in the 19th
      century looks and tastes pretty much the same as the one served today at
      any decent cocktail bar. The Manhattan’s mix of American whiskey and
      Italian vermouth, enlivened with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is
      timeless and tasty—the very definition of what a cocktail should be.

      Rye's spicier, edgier profile makes it a better choice in this cocktail
      than bourbon, but really, you can go with whichever you prefer. And while
      Angostura bitters are a must in any variation, a single dash of orange
      bitters helps brighten the cocktail’s edges, bringing the whiskey and
      vermouth together seamlessly, while the brandied cherry garnish lends a
      touch of sweetness.

    <p>
      Despite all of the Manhattan’s unassailable qualities, bartenders and
      enterprising drinkers have still found ways to tweak the recipe into
      myriad variations. If you split the vermouth between sweet and dry, you
      get the Perfect Manhattan. If you switch the ratios to make vermouth the
      star, you’ve stirred up a Reverse Manhattan. The Rob Roy is essentially a
      scotch Manhattan. And then you’ve got other named-for-New York cocktails
      like the Red Hook and Brooklyn, which employ their own twists to take the
      drink in new directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But regardless of all the options, there is only one classic Manhattan:
      two parts whiskey, one part sweet vermouth and bitters. Mix one (stirred,
      never shaken), and you’ll see why this storied drink has remained a
      favorite since its inception.
